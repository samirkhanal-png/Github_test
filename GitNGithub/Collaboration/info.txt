git remote add 

=>make the local machine's code get synced to the remote server

we can give a remote server a user friendly name

By convention we call it origin 

then we give the address

git remote add origin address(SSH)

Anyone can push on the server with the link

But we use SSH key to push due to which it is more secured

Here’s the general format of an SSH public key:

php
Copy code
<key_type> <key_value> <comment>
Key Type: Usually either ssh-rsa or ssh-ed25519.
Key Value: A long, encoded string that represents the public key.
Comment: Typically your email or a label to identify the key’s purpose.
Example of an SSH Key
bash
Copy code
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIKN9gSkskYk1RViJ/ZbB1/niHmf5tjEAm7xN+03e3f1D your_email@example.com
This format is what you’ll paste into GitHub (or other services) when adding an SSH key. If you generated the key using ssh-keygen, you can find it in your ~/.ssh/ directory, in a file typically named id_ed25519.pub or id_rsa.pub.

To view the key, run:

bash
Copy code
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
or

bash
Copy code
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Copy the entire line and paste it wherever needed.

In Git (and GitHub), "upstream" refers to the remote branch that your local branch is tracking. Setting an upstream branch allows you to synchronize your local changes with a specific branch on the remote repository, making git push and git pull commands simpler.
